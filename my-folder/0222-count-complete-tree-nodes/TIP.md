# Tip â€” Understanding 1 << k (Bitwise Left Shift)
/**
 * TIP
 * Problem: Understanding 1 << k (Bitwise Left Shift)
 *
 * Summary:
 * - `<<` is the bitwise left shift operator in Java.
 * - `1 << k` shifts the number 1 left by `k` bits, which is equivalent to 2^k.
 * - This is often used in problems involving powers of 2, complete binary trees, or bitmasking.
 *
 * Example:
 * 1 << 3 = 8   // 1000 in binary
 * 1 << 4 = 16  // 10000 in binary
 *
 * Usage in LeetCode:
 * - Common in problems like "Count Complete Tree Nodes" where you calculate nodes in a full binary subtree:
 *   int nodes = 1 << leftHeight;  // computes number of nodes in a perfect binary subtree
 *
 * Pitfall:
 * - Remember operator precedence: `(1 << k)` is safe, avoid writing `1 << k + 1` without parentheses.
 * - `<<` only works with integer types; results may overflow if k is too large.
 *
 * Key points:
 * - Efficient way to compute powers of 2.
 * - Often used in combination with recursion or tree traversal to calculate counts.
